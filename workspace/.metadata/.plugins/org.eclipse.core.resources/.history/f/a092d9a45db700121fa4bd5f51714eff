A nice, elaborated, well-planned trip will make you feel happy and relaxed, and you can throw yourself into work or study more efficiently.

After login, user can choose to create a new travel plan or keep track of the current plan. The first part is to create a new plan. TPS allows every user to have an account to keep track of their arrangement. The travel itinerary is based on user itself, which allow user to be creative. In order to create a travel itinerary, the system provides a calendar, which is synchronized to GMT (Greenwich mean time). It provides a world map that shows the points of interest. The map is clickable; click on different regions will show the information of that point of interest and zoom the pictures. The map is user friendly, you can sketch the routine that you want to go by just dragging your mouse from place to place (mouse events). For another option, you can choose the places manually. After choosing the destinations, the system will remind you to decide how many days to stay in each place. Furthermore, the system will generate the plane tickets according to user¡¯s previous settings. The seat reservation will be using 2D array. It charges various rates for particular sections of the plane. Example, first class is going to cost more than coach. The fee and billhead will be notified and user can easily login their RPS Bank account to pay the bill. The seat reservation will be synchronized to the calendar on the homepage, so do the destinations. In the meantime, the system will pops up a hotel reservation window, user can manage the hotels ahead of time or save it for later. Hotel reservation will also be achieved by 2D array. There will be a button like ¡°Add to Cart¡±, all the costs will be listing on one page. The costs auto-connects to RPS Bank, which reminds you if the expenses exceed your budget. You can easily modify the plan by click on the item you want to change. So that user can minimize the costs. The system will go back to the setting page of that item and let the user change it. TPS also provide a currency converter for traveller who travels around different countries. After confirming the cost list, user will receive a complete schedule of trip. The schedule will be saved as a file with user¡¯s account on the computer."+"\n");
		      TextArea.append("     The second part is to keep track on your plan. Every user has an account; the account will read the files on the computer every time the user login. After login, you can see some useful apps on your homepage, like calculator, currency converter, Google the place you are going and some little games to kill time. More importantly, you can modify your travel plan anytime such as adding people, places, days; changing routines, flights and hotels by adding the corresponding costs."+"\n");
