<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">Support of traditional SSI commands</h1>

The aim is to provide functionality similar to what the Apache
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html">
<code>mod_include</code>
</a>
module has.
You need this feature if you want to use <em>both</em>
traditional SSI and the <code>&lt;SERVLET&gt;</code> 
tag within the same page.
<p>

In order to make the commands work,
you've to add the <code>SSISiteRoot</code> init
argument. See the <a href="install.html#tradssi">installation instructions</a>.
<p>

<strong><em>Experimental</em></strong>. 
Currently,
only a subset of the Apache SSI directives is implemented, and their
functionality is restricted as well. 
Follow closely the development of Apache JSSI if you need more than 
this.
<p>

You might want to check out the 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html">
<code>mod_include</code>
documentation</a> (link to the web).
This document implicitly refers to it when missing features
are discussed.

<H2>Commands</H2>

A traditional SSI command has the syntax:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
&lt;!--#</CODE><EM>element attribute=value attribute=value ...</EM>
<CODE> --&gt;
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The value will often be enclosed in double quotes; many commands only allow
a single attribute-value pair.  Note that the comment terminator
(<SAMP>--&gt;</SAMP>) should be preceded by whitespace to ensure that it
isn't considered part of an SSI token.
<P>
The allowed elements are:<P>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>config</STRONG>
<DD>
This command controls various aspects of the parsing. The valid attributes
are:
<DL>
<DT>sizefmt
<DD>The value sets the format to be used which displaying the size of a file.
Valid values are <CODE>bytes</CODE> for a count in bytes, or
<CODE>abbrev</CODE> for a count in Kb or Mb as appropriate.
<DT>timefmt
<DD>The value is a string to be used by the <CODE>strftime(3)</CODE> library
routine when printing dates.
</DL>
errmsg is not implemented.

<DT><STRONG>echo</STRONG>
<DD>
This command prints one of the include variables, defined below.
If the variable is unset, it is printed as <CODE>(none)</CODE>.
Any dates printed are subject to the currently configured <CODE>timefmt</CODE>.
Attributes:
<DL>
<DT>var
<DD>The value is the name of the variable to print.
</DL>

<DT><STRONG>fsize</STRONG>
<DD>
This command prints the size of the specified file, subject to the
<CODE>sizefmt</CODE> format specification. Attributes:
<DL>
<DT>file
<DD>The value is a path relative to the directory containing the current
document being parsed.
<DT>virtual
<DD>The value is a (%-encoded) URL-path relative to the current document being
parsed. If it does not begin with a slash (/) then it is taken to be relative
to the current document.
</DL>
The virtual attribute does not know about aliases, URL rewriting and the
like. Therefore, the result might be surprising to you.
This restriction applies to all directives which work on files.

<DT><STRONG>flastmod</STRONG>
<DD>
This command prints the last modification date of the specified file,
subject to the <CODE>timefmt</CODE> format specification. The attributes are
the same as for the <CODE>fsize</CODE> command.

<DT><STRONG>include</STRONG>
<DD>
This command inserts the text of another document or file into the parsed
file. Included files are not subject to the usual access control (unlike
with Apache <code>mod_include</code>).

The Apache IncludesNOEXEC feature is not implemented.
It is not needed, as the exec and cgi SSI commands are missing either.

An attribute defines the location of the document; the inclusion is done for
each attribute given to the include command. The valid attributes are:
<DL>
<DT>file
<DD>The value is a path relative to the directory containing the current
document being parsed. It cannot contain <CODE>../</CODE>, nor can it be an
absolute path. The <CODE>virtual</CODE> attribute should always be used
in preference to this one.
<DT>virtual
<DD>The value is a (%-encoded) URL relative to the current document being
parsed. The URL cannot contain a scheme or hostname, only a path and
an optional query string. If it does not begin with a slash (/) then it
is taken to be relative to the current document.
</DL>
A URL is constructed from the attribute, and the output the server
would return if the URL were accessed by the client is included in the parsed
output. Thus included files can be nested.

</DL>

<H2>Include Variables</H2>

The only variables currently available are

<DL>
<DT>DATE_GMT
<DD>The current date in Greenwich Mean Time.
<DT>DOCUMENT_NAME
<DD>The filename (excluding directories) of the document requested by the
user.
<DT>LAST_MODIFIED
<DD>The last modification date of the document requested by the user.
</DL>
<P>

No variable substitution is performed.

<H2>Other restrictions</H2>

The XBitHack Apache directive has no effect. (Which is not bad.)
