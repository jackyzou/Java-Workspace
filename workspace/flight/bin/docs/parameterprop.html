<h3>The Background</h3>
<blockquote><p>
Servlet engines provide a method to hold a user
session so that you're able to build complex applications on top of the usually
stateless HTTP-Protocol. You can access this session from the HttpServletRequest with
<code>getSession()</code> and are able to store any Object associated with that session.
</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>
A Session is represented by a unique string which allows the servlet engine to look
up the session object. This string has to be carried back and forth with each
request of the client to be able to identify the client belonging to the session.
There are currently two methods, servlet engines use to accomplish this task:
<ul>
<li>using cookies</li>
<li>with URL-rewriting</li>
</ul>
Cookies are name/value pairs stored at the Client (the browser) which can be requested
by the server. Thus using cookies is an ideal method to track sessions.</p>
<p>
Unfortunalety, not all browsers support cookies and many people switch off the cookie support
because of security concerns (that is a long story). 
In that case, the servlet engine has to pass the sessionid as parameter with every form
action or URL. In order to pass the SessionID in servlet generated
URLs, the <code>HttpServletResponse</code> has a method <code>encodeURL()</code>
which does that (the generated URL looks e.g. 
  <code>http://www.foo.bar/servlet/SessionApp?sessionid=819ab810</code>)
<p>
For further information see the servlet documentation 
or the chapter about 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/servlets/client-state/session-tracking.html" target="_top">Session Tracking</a> in the Java Tutorial.
</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Embedding servlets in SSI-files (*.jthml) allows you to seperate program logic from 
static layout. However, if you use sessions and the client doesn't support cookies 
you're (or better: the <em>session</em> is) lost if the user chooses to follow a 
link in the static part of the jhtml-file: it doesn't contain the parameter with the
session so the next time you come over one of your application servlets there is no
session ...
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<blockquote><p>
One solution to this problem would be to append a servlet call to each URL in the
SSI-page in order to dump out the sessionid. Ugly. Error prone. Slow.
</p>
<p>
The <code>ParameterPropagatingSSI</code> Servlet distributed with this Apache JSSI is
able to rewrite <code>&lt;A HREF=..</code> URLs automatically. It appends GET-parameters 
to any URL if the parameter passed to the page is not null. 
You've just to specify which parameter name(s) you want to have propagated.
In our example it would be the <code>sessionid</code> parameter which has to be propagated;
Apache JServ uses the special parameter <code>JServSessionId</code> to hold the session. So
you've to find out what name your servlet engine uses if you want to track the session.<p>
BTW: URLs in <code>&lt;AREA&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;FRAME&gt;</code> tags are rewritten as
well.
</p>
<p>
Since you can propagate <em>any</em> parameter you can implement your own session 
handling passing <em>your</em> own parameter(s) you need to track your users session.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<blockquote>
Installation is quite easy. The <code>ParameterPropagatingSSI</code> is a servlet
which implements the normal &lt;SERVLET&gt;-SSI features (as well as the
<a href="traditionalssi.html">traditional SSI</a>) so it can replace the usual
SSI. So <a href="install.html">install it</a> like the normal SSI servlet.
<p>
You propably may choose to use a simple SSI to treat your *.jhtml-files and
the <code>ParameterPropagatingSSI</code> for some other files e.g. *.pjhtml
or something like that.
</p>
<p>
You've to give the parameters to be propagated in the init-argument named
<code>PropagateParameters</code> as semicolon separated list.
<ul>
<font size=-1>
<code>PropagateParameters=JServSessionId;myvariable</code>
</font>
</ul>
If you use Apache JServ as servlet engine, you've to give the init argument in
your zone.properties file:
<ul>
<font size=-1>
<code>servlet.org.apache.servlet.ssi.ParameterPropagatingSSI.initArgs=PropagateParameters=JServSessionId;myvariable</code>
</font>
</ul>
